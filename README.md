Austin Taylor's notable programs

These are the program's I've written for personal use. in the "Arduino" folder are my Arduino programs in the C-like Arduino language. in the "DiImmortales" folder is a basic text-based combat simulator in C++.

In each program's folder is a details.txt that describes what the program does.
