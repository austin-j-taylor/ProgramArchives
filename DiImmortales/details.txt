Di Immortales is a short text-based adventure game (really just a battle simulator).

Play as Diana, Apollo, or Odium who, for whatever reason, feels the need to strike down Hades, Apollo (the Greek one), and Adam Smith, author of The Wealth of Nations.

It has a few bugs here and there, but certainly works and isn't too easy to win.

It has a functional save/load system for data persistence between plays but doesn't provide true boons for winning.

The executable can be found in the "Di Immortales Executable" folder.
