Di Immortales is a short text-based adventure game (really just a battle simulator, to be honest). It's not finished (and probably never really will be) as I'm still adding new features whenever I feel like it.

Play as Diana who, for whatever reason, feels the need to strike down Hades, Apollo, and Adam Smith, author of "The Wealth of Nations."

It has a few bugs here and there, but certainly works and isn't too easy to win.
